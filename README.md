## Project Description
The aim of this project is to gain insights that address various business challenges, including customer segmentation, retention, cross-selling, upselling, marketing campaign optimization, inventory management, and customer lifetime value (CLV) estimation. This will be achieved using SQL and Power BI to explore and analyze the AdventureWorks2022 dataset.

### DISCLAIMER: This is not a real company as we know that adventure works database is compiled by Microsoft for learning purposes.
